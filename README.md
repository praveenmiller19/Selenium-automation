# Selenium-automation
Selenium is a suite of tools for automating web browsers.

WebDriver
If you are beginning with desktop website or mobile website test automation, then you are going to be using WebDriver APIs. WebDriver uses browser automation APIs provided by browser vendors to control the browser and run tests. This is as if a real user is operating the browser. Since WebDriver does not require its API to be compiled with application code; It is not intrusive. Hence, you are testing the same application which you push live.
